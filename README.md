Final Project I did for my Algorithms & Data Structure module.

Made in Processing ver 3.2.1 and programmed using Java.

Objective was to make a cheetah chasing the rabbit game using the knowledge we learned to create it including:
- Recording the steps in different data structures for each animal took and display it in order.
- Make one version played by 2 players and another version player vs computer.
